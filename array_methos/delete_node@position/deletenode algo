step1: cheack the head empty are not if empty means return null
step2: crete a variable for to store the head nodetodelete
step3: check the position is equal 0 means return the nodetodelete.next in head and return the ead
step4: create variable for count the position initiaze with 0
step5: create variable for previoust node
step6: traverse the nodetodelete using while loop check the position is equal to count
means prev.next = nodetodelete.next
return head
step7: prev is store the nodetodelete and nodetodelete is store the nodetodelete.next count++
return the null
